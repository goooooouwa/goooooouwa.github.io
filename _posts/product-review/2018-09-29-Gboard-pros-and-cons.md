Pros

- Quick access Emojis, search GIFs and hand drawings
- Google search and YouTube built in
- Swapping keys makes typing fast and easy, like magic
- Clean simple and fast, not missing native keyboard very much

Cons

- Trackpad only moves horizontal, but luckily wrapping lines fast.
- No quick character selection by swapping with direction in 9-keys keyboard layout, e.g. quick select question mark.
- Keys are shorter and smaller, harder to type (maybe saving space for Google search).
- Dictation requires jumping back and forth between current app and Gboard app, so that Gboard granted audio access.
