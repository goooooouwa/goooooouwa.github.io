It's important to show highlights & notes in context, but the web platform itself is unstable, pages might be changed at anytime. So highlights and notes should be preserved regardless of the page.

**Scribble**  
Limited free account

**Diigo**  
Limited free account, good enough.

**Weava**

**Highly**  
Free plan only support public highlights. Doesn't support annotation.

**hypothes.is**  
free. Support highlight and annotation. Support tagging. Decent search. It has tag overview with count, good! But you have to tag each highlight or annotation, kind of sad. But good enough.

**Evernote**  
Hard to take multiple highlight on same page (can do by saving multiple notes and then merge together). Highlights and annotations will probably make Evernote a cluster? Tagging is acceptable. Can not show highlights & notes in context.
