《Making It Right》学习笔记

How important is business for a company?

Development needs get ignored much of the time in favour of the more tangible front-end and business requirements.

—Making It Right

For every company that considers software product as one of their Key Assets, technical needs should be among their top priorities, alone with business needs and user needs.

For outsourcing products though, this is often not the case. Outsourcing products are often non-key to client companies, because no company will outsource their key assets. To them, technical needs are often ignored much of the time in favour of the more tangible front-end and business requirements.

But ignoring technical needs only leaves to disaster. That’s why outsourcing products are often short-lived, because they couldn’t live up their own weight and eventually collapse.

If the debt grows large enough, eventually the company will spend more on servicing its debt than it invests in increasing the value of its other assets.

—Making It Right

So let’s accept the fact that outsourcing products are by definition crap, unless someone stand up against the ignorance of technical needs. I think we as the ones who bear under the development, should stand up and shout for technical needs. Because if succeeded, it will make everyone’s life better.

Treat business needs and user needs no different than technical needs, they’re born equal. So don’t treat feature testing more important than unit testing.

Long term success over short term success. Meaning alway do the right thing in long term, not short term.
