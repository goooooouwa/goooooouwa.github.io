## GT3 to the rescue

According to [Red Bull](https://www.redbull.com/sg-en/gt-racing-101-a-guide-for-the-perplexed):

> “As costs escalated, GT2 was ignored and GT1 cars weren’t suitable for the likes of a 24-hour race at Spa, so GT3 cars joined the fray and that was where the idea of Blancpain came from,” affirms Addison. “GT3 became so popular, interest in the GT1 series dissipated – GT3 was cheaper – the FIA GT Championship then became the Blancpain GT Sprint series, jettisoned the FIA tag and all associated expenses.”

### How to reconginze Intercontinental GT Challenge cars in the Total 24 Hours of Spa

In addition to the Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup, the Total 24 Hours of Spa represents the marquee event for the Intercontinental GT Challenge Powered by Pirelli. While this is a separate championship, its record contingent of 28 nominated cars will fall under the same class structure as the rest of the field. In terms of the race, they are no different from any other entrant. Nominated cars will be easily identifiable thanks to a white Blancpain windscreen sticker, as opposed to the usual black decal.
