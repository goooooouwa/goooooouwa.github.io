军事是什么？战争是什么？反恐精英让我很感兴趣的，原因是他让我接触到了枪战和军事战争。我很想知道什么是战争和军事射击。传统的国产战争片，无论是古代还是现代，都很少描绘真实的战争场景，而是笼统的一大群士兵冲上去厮杀。比如国产的抗日片，一大群士兵拿着步枪冲上去厮杀。

二战是什么回事，反恐行动是什么回事，战争in general 是怎么回事？

战争或者军事行动是很复杂的，有多个层面，战略层面，行动层面，战术层面。

要分大规模（theater）中规模（campaign）小规模（battle），

还分近距离（CQC)远距离(long distance)中距离，

还分类型突袭(assault)侦察(recon)渗透(infiltration)。

还分地形，open field, 室内，山地，城区，

Ground troops (refine, engineer, sniper), ground viechles (tanks, bikes, etc), Air Force

Weapons: missoles (地对空，long range，洲际），C4, smoke, 手枪, rifle, sniper rifle, shotgun,





### Types of military operations

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_war)



Types of military operations, by scope:

- Theater – operation over a large, often continental area of operation and represents a strategic national commitment to the conflict such as Operation Barbarossa, with general goals that encompass areas of consideration outside of the military such as the economic and political impacts.
- Campaign – subset of the theatre operation, or a more limited geographic and operational strategic commitment such as Battle of Britain, and need not represent total national commitment to a conflict, or have broader goals outside of the military impacts.
- Battle – subset of a campaign that will have specific military goals and geographic objectives, as well as clearly defined use of forces such as the Battle of Gallipoli, which operationally was a combined arms operation originally known as the "Dardanelles landings" as part of the Dardanelles Campaign, where about 480,000 Allied troops took part.
- Engagement – tactical combat event of contest for specific area or objective by actions of distinct units. For example, the Battle of Kursk, also known from its German designation as Operation Citadel, included many separate engagements, several of which were combined into the Battle of Prokhorovka. The "Battle of Kursk" in addition to describing the initial German offensive operation (or simply an offensive), also included two Soviet counter-offensive operations Operation Kutuzov and Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev.
- Strike – single attack, upon a specified target. This often forms part of a broader engagement. Strikes have an explicit goal, such as, rendering facilities inoperable (e.g. airports), to assassinating enemy leaders, or to limit supply to enemy troops.
