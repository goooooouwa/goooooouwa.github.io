The build system isn’t the most important thing to the creative process. It’s like pipeline to coders, it’s necessary but not how code is written, ideally is set it and forget about it.

The actual creative process normally is very lightweight, doesn’t require much heavy lifting setup.

Production is heavy and workload intensive, the creative process is very lightweight, pens and paper, whiteboard and stickers are all its needed.

So don't look for any pro setup build system, unless you have learned to do the creative things, coding, writing, drawing, etc.
