Don't just generate one idea, generate many of them.

Steps to generate a product idea:

1. **listen and observe for problems that people are complaning about** (from your life, news, your envisioning of the future)
1. **validate the market for that problem** (do people really have the needs? is that an addressable market? market potential)
1. **find a solution to that problem** (ideation, brainstorming. business model, core technology)
1. **validate the solution** (does it solve the problem? is it profitable?)
