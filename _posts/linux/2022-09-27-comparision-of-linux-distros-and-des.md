During the past 2 weeks, I distro-hopped among multiple different distros and Desktop Environments, as listed below (in a timely order):

On my Legion R9000p 2021, I tried:

- Ubuntu
- Manjaro KDE
- Kubuntu
- Fedora
- Elementory OS

On my MacBook Air 2011, I tried:

- Ubuntu
- Lubuntu
- Linux Mint
- Manjaro KDE
- Kubuntu

On my Thinkpad X100e 2010, I tried:

- Lubuntu
- Linux Mint
- Manjaro XFCE
- Xubuntu
- Zorin OS Lite

Below is a summary of my experiences with these distro and DEs.

## Comparision of main Linux distros

- Ubuntu
- Fedora
- Manjaro

### Package availability

Ubuntu has most pacakges in the official repo
Fedora has fewer packages in official repo
Manjaro AUR has everything you need.

### Stability

Ubuntu is mot stable with oldest packages.
Fedora is more up to date with newer packages, but not as bleeding edge as Manjaro, thus relatively more stable.
Manjaro is bleeding edge, most up-to-date, but also possible unbootable after update.

### Hardware support

Ubuntu has the best hardward support (supported by most OEMs).
Fedora doesn't include pripertory drivers by default
Manjaro has built-in hardware detection.

## Comparision of main Linux Desktop Environments

- Gnome
- KDE
- XFCE

### UX experience

- Gnome has the best UX design out of the box.
- More app are made with GTK for Linux.
- KDE has good default UX.
- KDE has better support for Gnome apps then Gnome for KDE apps.
- KDE apps are more powerful and more customizable.
- XFCE can have a good UX after customization.

### Customizability

- Gnome is not customizable.
- KDE is very easy to customize.
- XFCE is very customizable.
