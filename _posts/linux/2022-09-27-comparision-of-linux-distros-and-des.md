During the past 2 weeks, I distro-hopped among multiple different distros and desktop environments. Below is a list of distros I tried on my laptops (in a timely order).

On my Legion R9000p 2021, I tried:

- Ubuntu
- Manjaro KDE
- **Kubuntu** (final choice)
- Fedora KDE
- Elementory OS

On my MacBook Air 2011, I tried:

- Ubuntu
- Lubuntu
- Linux Mint Cinnamon
- Chrome OS
- **Manjaro KDE** (final choice)

On my Thinkpad X100e 2010, I tried:

- Lubuntu
- Linux Mint
- Lakka
- Manjaro XFCE
- Lubuntu 16.04
- **Xubuntu 16.04** (final choice)
- Zorin OS Lite
- antiX Linux
- Android X86

Below is a summary of my experiences with the 3 main distros and DEs.

## Comparision of main Linux distros

- Ubuntu
- Fedora
- Manjaro

### Package availability

- Ubuntu has most pacakges in the official repo
- Fedora has fewer packages in official repo
- Manjaro AUR has everything you need.

### Stability

- Ubuntu is most stable while having oldest packages.
- Fedora is more up to date with newer packages, but not as bleeding edge as Manjaro, thus relatively more stable.
- Manjaro is bleeding edge, most up-to-date, but also possible to become unbootable after update.

### Hardware support

- Ubuntu has the best hardward support (supported by most OEMs).
- Fedora doesn't include pripertory drivers by default
- Manjaro has built-in hardware detection.

## Comparision of main Linux Desktop Environments

- Gnome
- KDE
- XFCE

### UX experience

- Gnome has the best UX design out of the box.
- More app are made with GTK for Linux.
- KDE has good default UX.
- KDE has better support for Gnome apps then Gnome for KDE apps.
- KDE apps are more powerful and more customizable.
- XFCE can have a good UX after customization.

### Customizability

- Gnome is not customizable.
- KDE is very easy to customize.
- XFCE is very customizable.
